### Function Keys
- `on`: Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys.

- `karabiner.json`

### Issues
- No `key_code/consumer_key_code/apple_vendor_keyboard_key_code` logged for F4 and F6 when using Karabiner. Had to remap spotlight and mission control.
- Need to turn on `Use all F1...` in function keys to be able to remap G7 & G8
- Cannot remap the ff: keys: G1 (`scan_previous_track`), G2 (`scan_next_track`)
